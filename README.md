# University Comp. App
University Companion app, or simply 'uca'

# What is this?
What is this project? It's basically a remake of a system that I proposed, developed, then defended back in college.
The system is a companion app for university students, which aims to make their lives easier by providing them a solid
web application that not only helps them manage academic related contexts such as billing, course attendance tracking, class scheduling, and so much more.

The old system was built on plain HTML, CSS, and PHP on top of having no frameworks integrated since I didn't know much about modern web development techniques back then. As I delve into frameworks, I'm taking the chance of bringing
back a pretty much dead project back to life with my learnings over time.
